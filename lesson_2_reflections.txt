When I initialized I reposity using git init on my existing directory, git created a .git file which, among other things, allows 
me to use all of the git tools on it, as well as allows git to track the changes in the revision history. It has to be done to 
start using git on that directory, in much the same way that the firefox icon needs to be clicken on before I can use firefox

The staging area is different from the working directory because, well, the working directory contains all your files, whereas
the staging area contains <= all the files you have. The repository, on the other hand, is all the stuff you have

We can use the staging area to make sure we have one commit per logical change because it allows us to only commit some files
to the repository, instead of all of them in one fell swoop
