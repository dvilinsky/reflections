Well, one benefit of using the fc command is that instead of having to hunt through the file for any possible change,
it basically did that for me. The computer did all of the work instead of me. 

I think having a version control system, or something that allows you to look at previous versions of the code 
would be helpful because maybe I want to bring back an old feature, maybe I want to look at how I did something in the past.
There are a lot of reasons. 

Pros of manual commits: It allows you to decide what the logical breaks/cutoffs are in the development of the code. Additionally,
it reduces the number of commits, so that your history isn't cluttered with a lot of minute commits that are hard to differentiate
from one another.

Cons: It's possible that your computer will crash before you commit, causing you to lose all of your work. 


Obviously, you'd want to commit multiple files at once because often code in one file depends on code in another file. 

We can use git log and git diff to view the history of commits because, well, git log literally gives us a list of all the commits
ever in recorded history, and git diff tells us the differences between each commit

Well, I know that if I break something, I can just sort of hit "undo." But I can do that with a text editor. So I'm not sure 
what advantage git has here

I want to actually use git to upload stuff to github. I want to create a reposity, and iteratively commit changes to the code 
in it. I also want to learn how to pull from other people's work and edit it
