When I initialized I reposity using git init on my existing directory, git created a .git file which, among other things, allows 
me to use all of the git tools on it, as well as allows git to track the changes in the revision history. It has to be done to 
start using git on that directory, in much the same way that the firefox icon needs to be clicken on before I can use firefox
