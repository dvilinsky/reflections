You might want to create a file just on github and not on your local machine if you're working with other people and you're getting the file started for that but you don't necessarily need to or want to ahve it on your computer 

You'd want to manually pull because, if you have multiple people working on a project, you wouldn't want changes the make in thier
code to interfere with your own. If your code depends on some class that is in a certain state on your local version, and
then someone on another machine updates that class such that it might interfere with your code, you wouldn't want git to make 
that reflection automatically. 

Let's start with branches. Branches allow you to work on different versions of your code on your local machine. 
Clones and forks are related to each other. A clone copies a repository on github to your local machine. A fork clones a repository
on github into another github repository. You'd use one instead of the other when you want to perform the actions listed.

The benefit of having a local copy of the last known state of the remote copy is, well, so you can keep track of the history
of the remote and see if any changes you're making are conflicting with them
